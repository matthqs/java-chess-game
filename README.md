# Java Chess Game with JavaFX GUI

This Java Chess Game project is developed for personal studies of object-oriented programming (OO) concepts and JavaFX GUI development using Java 22.
It provides a fully functional implementation of the classic game of chess.

## Features:

- **Complete Chess Game:** Enjoy playing the classic game of chess with a computer opponent or with another player locally.
- **OO Principles:** Apply object-oriented programming throughout the codebase.
- **JavaFX GUI:** Utilize JavaFX for building the graphical user interface for the chess game.
- **Stalemate Detection:** Implement detection and handling of stalemate situations to ensure fair gameplay.
- **Check Detection:** Identify when a king is under threat from an opponent's piece to prevent illegal moves.
- **En Passant:** Support the en passant rule allowing pawns to capture other pawns as they move forward two squares from their starting position.
- **Castling:** Implement castling, a special move involving the king and either of the original rooks of the same color.
- **Piece Promotion:** Allow pawn promotion where pawns can be exchanged for a more powerful piece upon reaching the opposite end of the board.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java 22 and JavaFX installed on your system.
3. Build the project using your favorite Java IDE or compile using command-line tools.
4. Run the application and start exploring the chess game with JavaFX GUI!

## Contributing:

This project is developed for personal studies, but contributions are welcome! Feel free to experiment with the codebase, implement new features, or suggest improvements to enhance learning experiences.
